# Pyramid Challenge Reborn [![Discord][discordImg]][discordLink] [![Curseforge][curseImg]][curseLink]

This 1.12.2 pack is built around FTB Retro SSP. This is the pack their pyramid challenge was based on. That map was designed to test a user’s knowledge of Minecraft mods. Start your adventure, build everything from nothing, and try to feed the beast. The modpack is a recreation of that modpack with the same mods, and the same idea. 

This mod pack is heavily focused on ProjectE and your transmutation table
